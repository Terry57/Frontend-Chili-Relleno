	<p>Always keep your fingers tucked in on your non-dominant hand, using your upper knuckle to guide your knife while you slice. If your finger tips are tucked in, you don' want to  cut them! And for the highest degree of control over your knife. hold knife by the blade, pinching the bottom of the blade between your thumb and forefinger. Grip your ring, and pinky fingers around the handle for support, and avoid laying your forefinger over the spine of the knife.

	<ul>Basic Cooking Rules
		<li> 1. Set up your workspace by gathering clean tools, bowls and utensils. And make sure to keep a trashcan within arm’s reach.</li> 

		<li>2. To create an egg wash, whisk together a large egg with one tablespoon of water until smooth. Use as a glue to seal pastries, then brush on top for a glossy appearance.</li>

		<li>3. Peel tomatoes with ease! Cut an X in the top, and then simmer in a pot of hot water for 15 to 30 seconds. Cool down and the skin will fall right off.</li>

		<li>4. Get comfortable! Wear comfy clothes and an apron when you work in the kitchen and you won’t have to worry about getting dirty.</li>

		<li>5. Invest in a baking scale. Scales are not only an accurate way to measure your cooking ingredients, but they streamline the entire process.</li>

		<li>6. Always read and re-read your recipes before you start cooking.</li>

		<li>7. Clean as you go.</li>
